## **Introducing LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Satellite**

The internet and communication technologies (ICTs) have undeniably facilitated transformation and brought countless opportunities around the world. It provided economic and social improvements that set the path for progress and the betterment of people and society's lives. However, this advancement is not shared by everyone. 

According to research studies, about half of the world's population does not have access to an internet connection because it necessitates a vast network of underground connections. As such, for locations without direct access to fiber-optic internet, connecting to high bandwidth satellite communication is their option. However, these are operated by geo satellites that orbit 35,000 km above the earth’s surface. Thus, this huge distance results in high latency, limited data transmission, and insufficient data capacity, especially in remote areas.

With this, the search for exploration to connect all individuals to the internet begins. As such, several space companies are extending Earth-based technologies by launching low Earth orbit satellite systems (Cooke, 2021). 	

**Low Earth orbit (LEO)** satellites are communication satellites designed to provide low latency internet broadband access and fast data transmissions around the world, including the most remote regions. These satellites orbit between 160 km to about 2000 km above Earth’s surface, as such, their close proximity resolves the existing latency and data transmission issues. This allows for internet connections and data to be transmitted in about 50 milliseconds, which is 6 to 8 times faster than geo satellites. To receive the internet, people would need small antennas in their homes to beam at the satellite and receive their connection.

With the power of LEO satellites, it is possible that people's lives may be improved even further. As internet service expands to locations with limited access to technology, it has the potential to transform global connectivity and give endless options to everyone. People would have improved access to information, education, professional opportunities, and healthcare regardless of where they live. As a result, rural villages would be revitalized, while urban congestion and pollution would be reduced. 

Further, LEO satellites intend to provide internet access to in-flight and maritime communications, as well as during disasters. Having a satellite internet and data service readily available during these situations would provide a more secure future as emergency response groups, disaster recovery teams, military units, and scientific explorations may all work with ease (Cooke, 2021).

Moreover, LEO satellites are not restricted to delivering internet access; they can also power mobile phones and be used in a variety of applications such as text messaging, self-driving cars, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As such, LEO satellite systems could be a viable and cost-effective alternative to millions of cellphone towers connected by lines of cables.


### Current and Ongoing LEO Ventures

- **SpaceX's [Starlink](www.starlink.com)** - Starlink is engineered by SpaceX, the American aerospace company. Starlink has been launching its constellation of LEO satellites since 2018. These satellites orbit the planet about 550 km above the surface. It aims to provide a maximum internet speed of 150 Mbps, allowing for the smooth operation of online services such as online gaming and live streaming. As of November 2021, Starlink has launched 1,844 satellites into orbit. They intend to release 42,000 satellites during the next five years, with half of them launched by 2024. Starlink satellite services are currently available in several parts of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, with intentions to increase its coverage area when more satellites are launched. Their initial price is at $99 USD a month on top of the $499 USD fee for the equipment. 

- **Amazon's [Project Kuiper](www.aboutamazon.com/news/tag/project-kuiper)** - Project Kuiper (also known as Kuiper) is a LEO satellite project funded by Amazon. According to reports, Amazon is investing at least $10 billion USD in this space venture. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave them permission to operate as long as they do not interfere with SpaceX’s project, Starlink.  As of today, it has not launched any satellites yet but plans to release 3,200 satellites and be operational by 2026. Project Kuiper intends to orbit 500 to 600 kilometers above the Earth's surface and provide at least 400 Mbps internet speed. Moreover, in their December 2020 update, Amazon revealed that they would offer an “affordable customer terminal” that would provide the same internet connection speed as the expensive ones. As such, this affordable user terminal might be the greatest way to revolutionize the internet connections of developing countries and remote regions. 

- **Bharti Enterprises' [One Web](www.oneweb.net/)** - During the COVID-19 pandemic, One Web went bankrupt and was bought by the United Kingdom government and Bharti Global, an Indian telecommunication company, in 2020. Currently, they have at least a hundred satellites launched in space. The company strives to provide 5G-ready networks with at least 50 to 100 ms latency. According to One Web, each of their satellites can cover an area of 663,300 square miles and constantly moves in orbit in a constellation design. Moreover, the company promises to remove the satellites from space after their service life to avoid congestion in the earth’s orbit. As such, they plan to offer global satellite internet service in 2022. 

- **TeleSat’s [Lightspeed](www.telesat.com/leo-satellites/)** - TeleSat is a satellite firm established in Canada that has been at the forefront of offering connectivity services for over 50 years. As such, they have proven their ability to give internet access to customers, which they intend to expand using Lightspeed LEO satellite services. With this, they seek to eliminate and bridge the existing digital divide in the world. Thus, in January 2018, they launched their first satellite and they now have 298 state-of-the-art satellites orbiting in space. Moreover, Lightspeed plights multiple benefits such as high throughput, low latency, flexible and dynamic bandwidth, continuous network connection, quick service integration, and cost-effectiveness. Today, they are operating in Ottawa but plans to expand their reach to Quebec and, eventually, the rest of the world.

- **Jeff Bezos' [Blue Origin](www.blueorigin.com/)** - Blue Origin is also owned by Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos. Though this company's space enterprise has yet to enter orbit, it has signed contracts to launch satellites for TeleSat Canada and One Web in the United Kingdom using the heavy-life and reusable rocket, New Glenn. Nevertheless, it also plans to expand internet connectivity in the world with cutting-edge LEO satellites. 

- **ViaSat's [XVI](www.viasat.com/space-innovation/space-systems/small-satellites/)** - ViaSat is an American telecommunications company based in California. It provides high-speed internet connection services to commercial markets and military units via satellites. Currently, they are working on a LEO satellite named XVI, which will try to extend the range of military communication's Link 16. It intends to improve communications satellite technology, tactical data linkages, and network encryption on the battlefield. Once proven feasible, the company eyes to expand its service to the rest of the world by providing IP and broadband internet networks anywhere.
