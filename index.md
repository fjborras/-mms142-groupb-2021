# **The Future of Connectivity**

Over the last few decades, technological progress is exponentially growing. Roser & Ritchie (2013) emphasized that as the computational power increases, the product quality increases too. Thus, creating the value of these technologies to be more expensive, and not everyone can afford this, even if it is necessary nowadays. 

## **Digital Inequalities**

## **Census of Disconnected Communities**

As technologically progressive we think about the world, a little less than half of the world’s population (47%), or approximately 3.6 billion people do not use the Internet (STL Partners, 2020). One of the reasons is the lack of coverage. And the number one victim of it is the rural areas. Under Geneva (2020), 72% of urban households have an Internet connection. While rural areas only have 38%, almost half compared to urban’s.

As reported by Reyes (2020), 60% of the population does not have access to the Internet in the Philippines. Related to the previously mentioned, the difference between urban and rural is also an alarming concern here in the Philippines. The difference of averaged fixed broadband download speed is 21.03 Mbps, between the five of the wealthiest cities (mostly urban areas) and the poorest cities (mostly rural areas) in the Philippines.  

Despite the inevitable technological advancements, not every country can keep with the pace of leading countries in technology. Thus, growing the digital gap. One of the initiatives to alleviate this is the introduction of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites. It may not solve all the corresponding issues that widen the digital gap. However, it will benefit the disconnected communities due to lacking coverage and fundings.

## **Are Disruptive Technologies an answer to digital inequalities?**

From the word “disruptive”, disruptive technology pertains to any emerging technology, often obscure, that provides a substantial modification to the built-in system of how consumers, current technologies, and markets operate. In simpler terms, an older process, product, or habit is replaced by a disruptive technology. At least to early users, it typically possesses better features that are readily apparent. Disruptive technologies are usually developed by upstarts but are also administered by established businesses as they have better capacities in financial and project implementation aspects. 

Since a disruptive technology has features that are greater in comparison to its potential competition, disruptive technology then makes these systems and behaviors obsolete as clamor from prospective consumers increases.

Clayton Christensen, a celebrated consultant in the field of business and academics, publicized the concept of disruptive technology from his book entitled The Innovator's Dilemma which was released in 1997. Since then, the term disruptive technology raises a significant start-up strategy for any business, corporates, and developers in attempting to produce a distinctive mass-market offering (Smith, 2020).

A dilemma in the concepts of new technology, however, is that it may be defined as sustaining or disruptive. While the latter refers to the gradual advancements in existing technology that supplement and create a better consumer and technology experience, disruptive technology is something entirely new in the market. As a result, the actual application and processes of such technology may be dubious and new for potential consumers.

![Disruptive Innovation Model](https://public-media.interaction-design.org/images/encyclopedia/disruptive_innovation/fig_1_the_disruptive_innovation_model.jpg)
_Figure 1: The Disruptive Innovation Model by Clayton Christensen._

Disruptive innovations are blended in markets together with existing competitions with the aim of providing a distinctive consumer experience that is indicative of its peculiarity among its competitions, thus making it disruptive. To achieve this, Christensen (1997) in his book “the Innovator’s Dilemma provided the Disrputive Innovation Model which identifies three crucial components of disruptive innovations.

First, a significant pace of progress of customer utilization and absorption is seen in every market, displaying a customer’s ability to use such technology for numerous benefits. Though it is simplified by a slowly progressing dotted line, in actuality, there are numerous lines that exist in a market that pertains to the individual demands of customers, represented by the distribution curve on the right. This explains the attribute of the line being dotted as the  performance that customers can utilize or support are distributed into numerous levels, hence producing irregularities which existing and disruptive technologies must cater to.

Second, innovating enterprises give a distinctively varied direction of development in each market when they introduce upgraded technologies. As shown in the figure, the elevated solid lines (blue and green) display the rate of technological improvement which evidently surpasses the level or capacity of consumers to support or utilize these new offerings. Why so? This is to establish to the market that a technology can leverage its current offerings and even supersede pre-existing market trends and cultures. As a result, a corporation whose goods are centered on  the majority of consumer's present demands is likely to surpass the current market will eventually use or need in the future. 

The dichotomy between sustaining and disruptive innovation is the model's third important component.Sustaining innovations (represented by the blue line) aims to provide better performance to high and low demanding customers through gradual, annual, or periodic improvements that all great businesses churn out are some sustaining innovations. Disruptive innovations, on the other hand, disregard the notion of trying to improve offerings for current customers in existing marketplaces. Instead, it infiltrates markets by delivering technologies and services that are distinct (may it be inferior or superior) to those currently offered, destablize and alter the market’s direction (Christensen, n.d.). 



## **Introducing LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Satellite**

The internet and communication technologies (ICTs) have undeniably facilitated transformation and brought countless opportunities around the world. It provided economic and social improvements that set the path for progress and the betterment of people and society's lives. However, this advancement is not shared by everyone. 

According to research studies, about half of the world's population does not have access to an internet connection because it necessitates a vast network of underground connections. As such, for locations without direct access to fiber-optic internet, connecting to high bandwidth satellite communication is their option. However, these are operated by geo satellites that orbit 35,000 km above the earth’s surface. Thus, this huge distance results in high latency, limited data transmission, and insufficient data capacity, especially in remote areas. 


![GEO, MEO, and LEO satellites orbital altitudes and coverage areas](https://www.satellitetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shorthand/322593/dlM6dKKvI6/assets/RmPx2fFwY3/screen-shot-2021-02-18-at-11-57-28-am-1314x498.png)

_Figure 2: GEO, MEO, and LEO satellites orbital altitudes and coverage areas._


With this, the search for exploration to connect all individuals to the internet begins. As such, several space companies are extending Earth-based technologies by launching low Earth orbit satellite systems (Cooke, 2021). 	

**Low Earth orbit (LEO)** satellites are communication satellites designed to provide low latency internet broadband access and fast data transmissions around the world, including the most remote regions. These satellites orbit between 160 km to about 2000 km above Earth’s surface, as such, their close proximity resolves the existing latency and data transmission issues. This allows for internet connections and data to be transmitted in about 50 milliseconds, which is 6 to 8 times faster than geo satellites. To receive the internet, people would need small antennas in their homes to beam at the satellite and receive their connection. 


![Comparison of GEO, MEO and LEO satellites](https://www.satellitetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/shorthand/322593/dlM6dKKvI6/assets/50snBkN5SH/screen-shot-2021-02-18-at-11-57-41-am-1258x1188.png)

_Figure 3: Comparison of GEO, MEO, and LEO satellites._


With the power of LEO satellites, it is possible that people's lives may be improved even further. As internet service expands to locations with limited access to technology, it has the potential to transform global connectivity and give endless options to everyone. People would have improved access to information, education, professional opportunities, and healthcare regardless of where they live. As a result, rural villages would be revitalized, while urban congestion and pollution would be reduced. 

Further, LEO satellites intend to provide internet access to in-flight and maritime communications, as well as during disasters. Having a satellite internet and data service readily available during these situations would provide a more secure future as emergency response groups, disaster recovery teams, military units, and scientific explorations may all work with ease (Cooke, 2021).

Moreover, LEO satellites are not restricted to delivering internet access; they can also power mobile phones and be used in a variety of applications such as text messaging, self-driving cars, and the Internet of Things (IoT). As such, LEO satellite systems could be a viable and cost-effective alternative to millions of cellphone towers connected by lines of cables.


### Current and Ongoing LEO Ventures

- **SpaceX's [Starlink](www.starlink.com)** - Starlink is engineered by SpaceX, the American aerospace company. Starlink has been launching its constellation of LEO satellites since 2018. These satellites orbit the planet about 550 km above the surface. It aims to provide a maximum internet speed of 150 Mbps, allowing for the smooth operation of online services such as online gaming and live streaming. As of November 2021, Starlink has launched 1,844 satellites into orbit. They intend to release 42,000 satellites during the next five years, with half of them launched by 2024. Starlink satellite services are currently available in several parts of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, with intentions to increase its coverage area when more satellites are launched. Their initial price is at $99 USD a month on top of the $499 USD fee for the equipment. 

- **Amazon's [Project Kuiper](www.aboutamazon.com/news/tag/project-kuiper)** - Project Kuiper (also known as Kuiper) is a LEO satellite project funded by Amazon. According to reports, Amazon is investing at least $10 billion USD in this space venture. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gave them permission to operate as long as they do not interfere with SpaceX’s project, Starlink.  As of today, it has not launched any satellites yet but plans to release 3,200 satellites and be operational by 2026. Project Kuiper intends to orbit 500 to 600 kilometers above the Earth's surface and provide at least 400 Mbps internet speed. Moreover, in their December 2020 update, Amazon revealed that they would offer an “affordable customer terminal” that would provide the same internet connection speed as the expensive ones. As such, this affordable user terminal might be the greatest way to revolutionize the internet connections of developing countries and remote regions. 

- **Bharti Enterprises' [One Web](www.oneweb.net/)** - During the COVID-19 pandemic, One Web went bankrupt and was bought by the United Kingdom government and Bharti Global, an Indian telecommunication company, in 2020. Currently, they have at least a hundred satellites launched in space. The company strives to provide 5G-ready networks with at least 50 to 100 ms latency. According to One Web, each of their satellites can cover an area of 663,300 square miles and constantly moves in orbit in a constellation design. Moreover, the company promises to remove the satellites from space after their service life to avoid congestion in the earth’s orbit. As such, they plan to offer global satellite internet service in 2022. 

- **TeleSat’s [Lightspeed](www.telesat.com/leo-satellites/)** - TeleSat is a satellite firm established in Canada that has been at the forefront of offering connectivity services for over 50 years. As such, they have proven their ability to give internet access to customers, which they intend to expand using Lightspeed LEO satellite services. With this, they seek to eliminate and bridge the existing digital divide in the world. Thus, in January 2018, they launched their first satellite and they now have 298 state-of-the-art satellites orbiting in space. Moreover, Lightspeed plights multiple benefits such as high throughput, low latency, flexible and dynamic bandwidth, continuous network connection, quick service integration, and cost-effectiveness. Today, they are operating in Ottawa but plans to expand their reach to Quebec and, eventually, the rest of the world.

- **Jeff Bezos' [Blue Origin](www.blueorigin.com/)** - Blue Origin is also owned by Amazon’s CEO, Jeff Bezos. Though this company's space enterprise has yet to enter orbit, it has signed contracts to launch satellites for TeleSat Canada and One Web in the United Kingdom using the heavy-life and reusable rocket, New Glenn. Nevertheless, it also plans to expand internet connectivity in the world with cutting-edge LEO satellites. 

- **ViaSat's [XVI](www.viasat.com/space-innovation/space-systems/small-satellites/)** - ViaSat is an American telecommunications company based in California. It provides high-speed internet connection services to commercial markets and military units via satellites. Currently, they are working on a LEO satellite named XVI, which will try to extend the range of military communication's Link 16. It intends to improve communications satellite technology, tactical data linkages, and network encryption on the battlefield. Once proven feasible, the company eyes to expand its service to the rest of the world by providing IP and broadband internet networks anywhere.

### Spectral interferences for other satellite operators

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.

### Cost of Entry

First, operating these satellites is costly. Kinney (2021) estimates that the production process and cost per satellite is around $1 million USD. Given that satellites have a total lifecycle of 5 to 7 years, keeping them operational for a lifetime would be prohibitively expensive. Moreover, the cost of launching LEO satellites is roughly equal to the price of manufacturing them. Given a projected cost of $2000 USD per kilogram, the launch cost for a few hundred kg LEO satellite is at least half the satellite's value. 

Second, LEO satellite ground stations are required to connect the entire world to the satellites. However, not all countries have them. As such, building these stations would be challenging, especially for developing countries that are already struggling financially. Resorting to other options such as establishing inter-satellite links (ISL), are just as expensive, if not more so. 

Further, the expensive cost of a user terminal is another issue as it is primarily driven by the prospective number of subscribers. User terminals are mobile satellite terminals that subscribers use to access wireless network services (IGI Global, n.d.). The prices of these terminals vary according to the number of users. Thus, given that the number of subscribers is uncertain, an affordable subscription fee may be impossible to achieve. As such, a subscription for a practical number of users would cost roughly $1000 USD. 
 
### Licensing issues

The widespread adoption of LEOs across countries may be further delayed by the fact that each country has its own set of licensing rules and regulations, and this could discourage operators from entering countries that might have strict and lengthy licensing processes (Garrity and Hussar, 2021). The table below shows an example of the licensing requirements in Asia and the Pacific.

![table](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95443192/145575870-f5d90389-00ae-4886-9fb2-bda4a1bafd1b.jpg)

### Space Sustainability

Space sustainability guarantees all countries to have access to space and to freely use it for various peaceful purposes. There are three prominent issues in space sustainability: space junk, space congestion, and space security.

![Space Sustainability](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Space-Sustainability-high-res-new.jpg)

_Figure 4: Space Sustainability._

### Space junk or orbital debris

Another issue concerned with the possible proliferation of low-earth orbit satellites is its possible contribution to space junk. As observed, the low-earth orbit is getting increasingly congested with space debris as a result of its suitability as a specified location for space satellite missions and launches that has been going on for the past years. The density of spacecrafts and satellites makes low-earth orbit a crucial source of concern. To picture out,  Elon Musk's Space Exploration Technologies Corp., for example, already has over 1,700 Starlink satellites in orbit and is currently seeking authorization from authorities to install 30,000 more to provide convenient internet connectivity from space (Shields, 2021). 

The usual common description of LEO is somewhere between 99 miles and 1,200 miles just above the Planet's surface (Yakolvev, 2005). Around this height, air molecules cause higher pressure, which causes orbital decay. This orbital delay occurs when satellites circulating in the thermosphere are subjected to an aerodynamic drag caused by changes in air mass densities, which causes satellite orbits to degrade, thus resulting in the reduction of satellite life spans. Due to the inconsistent modeling of this force,  there are inaccuracies in orbital projections, which makes it difficult to determine proper orbital circulations and reduction of risks in satellite collisions.

With this issue, these low-earth orbited spacecrafts and satellites must be augmented regularly to combat this downforce, or else their orbital motion would drop and they will drift into the lower atmosphere. This orbital decay causes a shorter life expectancy for LEO satellites, unlike GEO satellites' orbit which is commonly situated above the equator of the earth (around 22 thousand miles), which means aerodynamic drag is lesser than LEO (Shultz, 2020). This is one of the reasons why GEO satellites are way more resistant and live longer than LEO satellites, and its deterioration in the said space, adds to the accumulation of space debris floating around LEO such as collision-caused pieces, defunct satellites, and discarded spacecraft materials. 


### Congestion

If the deployment of LEO satellites is successful, the earth’s orbit will become increasingly congested and polluted. Consequently, astronomers' views will be obstructed, hampering their search for undiscovered planets or even black holes. Further, the increased congestion in the Earth's orbit increases the likelihood of space collisions. As such, this can result in the "_Kessler Syndrome_", in which debris collides with other satellites, causing even more debris. As a result, the space would be totally inaccessible and unsafe. 

### Light pollution

The International Astronomical Union have voiced their concern about LEO satellites affecting the quality of stargazing and the impact it will have on nocturnal life. When Starlink launched its first batch of satellites in May 2019, stargazers noticed how bright and visible they were in the night sky. To address the brightness problem, Starlink launched satellites in December 2019 with a special coating to reduce the spacecraft's reflectiveness, thereby reducing its likelihood to interfere with astronomical observations. Starting in June 2020, Starlink has used VisorSat, a light-blocking panel to block sunlight and reduce its visibility.


## **Conclusion**

Overall, LEO satellites could dramatically transform the world’s technologies, transportations, and connectivity. These cost-effective constellations have the ability to provide tangible solutions and change everyone’s lives for the better. These include but are not limited to the promotion of business digitalization, adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), and utilization of terrestrial data systems of military units and rescue operations. If the initial hurdles in its implementation could be overcome, then it could offer a myriad of possibilities for connecting all corners of the world, and maybe, perhaps, finally bridging the digital divide.
